;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the fundamental text mode documented in the
;; Emacs user's manual, along with improvements aimed at writers,
;; such as auto-correct and focus on current paragraph.

;;; Code:

(require 'text-mode)
(require 'flyspell)
(require 'focus)

(defconst writer-version "20210605.1")

;;;###autoload
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.writer\\'" . writer))

(define-derived-mode writer-mode text-mode "Writer"
  "Major mode for fiction and non-fiction writing.
Built on top on text-mode, this mode will autocorrect and focus on paragraphs."
  (flyspell-mode)
  (focus-mode))

(provide 'writer)
